# GE2FinalProject
## Plan:
The plan was to recreate the famous scene in Star Wars: A New Hope where the heroes first encounter the Death Star but I wanted to put my own spin on it. I planned on having the Millenium Falcon fleeing from the Death Star while being chased by a squad of Tie Fighters. 


## Features I want:
- Pathing for all the ships.
- Obstacle avoidance on the squad of Tie Fighters.
- Tie fighters being able to fire on the Falcon.
- Sounds used to tell my alternate story.
- Camera follow.
- Space skybox.

## Progress:
- Created the base project.
- Imported 3D models.
- Added scripts to models.
- Added pathing to spaceships.
- Added shooting, lasers, explosions.
- Added sounds and camera follow.
- Added in post processing bloom and grain for Star Wars look.
